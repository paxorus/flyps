Welcome! L: next click sets top-left corner R: next click sets bottom-right corner
C: clears image and data F: locate pixels
This program should first color all brown spots green (which will require some
empirical tuning), and then draw a semitransparent black circle at each fly. Hit
F to find them, D to revert to the original image.

Protocol:
My Android LG-D800 takes 2340x4160 (16:9) images. I focus on the vial label, set the camera to the 3-second timer, anticipate the appearance of 
the 2-second mark, and lift and drop the vial in one fell swoop.
